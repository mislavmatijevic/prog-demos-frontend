# Prog Demos Frontend

## Deploy APP locally

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
App will listen to http://localhost:8080 unless it's built for PROD, in that case it listens to https://api.progdemos.com.
